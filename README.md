## README

A side project of mine, I came up with this idea mainly because there was never a single site for me to get the latest news and streams about any specific video games. At best the info would be grouped together by genre or only provide one of the two resources. I aim to  bring the two together, using the Giantbomb, Bing, and Twitch API to provide a central source of obtaining up-to-date information about the video game of your choice. 

As of now the app is built with Rails and AngularJS (1.5). You can fork it if you wish, but you'll have to sign up for your own personal API keys and save it in a .env file.
