## README

A side project of mine, I came up with this idea because I wanted to play with API's that I thought were closely related to each other. Also, this project is pretty good as a stress reliever. The idea is to bring news, streams, and game details to a single portal using the Giantbomb, Bing, and Twitch API.

As of now the app is built with Rails and AngularJS (1.5). You can fork it if you wish, but you'll have to sign up for your own personal API keys and save it in a .env file.
